    "Finally, let's move beyond 3D visualisations, and add a \"time\" dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing your plots so that they are dynamic, rather than static, is a powerful tool. A dynamic plot can be one which updates itself over time, or one that can be updated/changed by user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to create dynamic plots can let you create animated visualisations, interactive visualisations, and even entire interactive visualisation dashboards. Any of these can be amazing for exploratory or explanatory data visualisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you might expect, there are a vast breadth of approaches to this topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "We only have time to scratch the surface of this topic. So, we are just going to do a basic animated visualisation, and a basic interactive visualisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In each case, we'll (by necessity), show just a single approach to animated/interactive visualisations. There are many, many more, and some applications/use cases will suit different methods. \n",

    "On Friday (or at the end of this class, if there's time), I'll talk more about useful tools for dynamic and interactive visualisations, and show some nice examples. "

    "### Animated visualisations\n",
    "\n",
    "We can animate our visualisations in a number of ways, which essentially all boil down to \"adding to, redrawing, or in any other sense *changing*\" a figure object that is already being displayed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward way to do this is using Matplotlib's **interactive mode**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mode allows us to create a figure and display the figure in a fairly standard way; but also allows for later sections of the code to change the figure object, and for us to push these changes *to* the displayed figure object by redrawing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use this approach, we first need to turn on interactive mode. Once we've imported ``matplotlib.pyplot as pl``, this is as simple as:\n",
    "\n",
    "``pl.ion()``\n",
    "\n",
    "ie, **I**nteractive mode **ON**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are ready for our figure to be displayed for the first time, we'd normally call ``pl.show()``. However, ``pl.show()`` will (normally) stop any subsequent code from running; the code is idle while the figure is displayed to the user, and only proceeds once the figure is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we work in interactive mode, we use the alternative ``pl.draw()``. This draws (or re-draws) the figure, but does not stop the rest of the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can draw one frame of our animation, and then (without the user having to do anything - no need, for example, to close the plot window), the code will proceed. This subsequent code can update the same figure object, and then (when we're ready), we can call pl.draw() again to update the figure contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example, and animate Mlebourne's historical urban development using our familiar buildings dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise One\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try to run the code: ``animate_example.py`` in Pycharm.\n",
    "* Ideally, you would first create a new project, and set up your 'plots', 'data' and 'scripts' directories as usual.\n",
